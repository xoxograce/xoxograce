      ‚ÄúHey Upper East Siders. Gossip Girl here. And I have the biggest news
      ever.‚Äù
      <br />
      <br />
      In a final bid to save 2020, HBO have pulled out the big guns and
      confirmed a reboot of the hit 2000s show Gossip Girl. The time has finally
      come for the next generation of New York‚Äôs richest, preppiest and most
      talked about teenagers to grace our screens. Original executive producers
      Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage are accompanying the return of the
      show, and official filming began in early November. With the show is
      expected to air in 2021, we know relatively little about the format of the
      show, yet the log line offers a few clues: ‚ÄúEight years after the original
      website went dark, a new generation of New York private school teens are
      introduced to the social surveillance of Gossip Girl. The prestige series
      will address just how much social media‚Äîand the landscape of New York
      itself‚Äîhas changed in the intervening years‚Äù. So many questions are
      circulating right now. Will Serena and Blair‚Äôs iconic show downs be
      replicated? Will the next Lonely Boy continue to struggle to fit in? Or
      perhaps social this generation of Upper East Siders will succumb to the
      modern-day pressures of social media. Gossip Girl fans are eagerly waiting
      to see what is install.
      <br />
      <br />
      There is another side to rebooted series, away from the excitement and
      anticipation. When a show, such as Gossip Girl, has been so strongly
      associated with crucial or significant parts of people‚Äôs lives, the
      expectations are always sky high. The nostalgia that can be drawn from
      re-watching shows can enthuse incredibly strong memories, and
      understandably, the thought of any attempts to rewrite that can be rather
      disconcerting. The comfort of these re-watches can be tremendous; the
      familiarities of character‚Äôs voices as they recite their iconic
      one-liners, the obvious plot-twist that still astonish you every time, and
      the season finales that are so embedded in your mind they feel like real
      life. Surely if a show is so highly adored and successful then a reboot is
      out of the question. Why on earth try and better it?!
      <br />
      <br />
      It is undeniable that the thought of the new series airing without the
      legendary insults from Blair Waldorf, the echoes of flip-phone
      notifications across the courtyard of St Jude‚Äôs, the headbands and pumps,
      and, of course, Dorota‚Äôs protection of Blair from Mr Chuck, is all quite
      strange. However, with a more diverse cast focusing on current themes,
      such LGBTQ relationships and the impact and danger of social media, I
      believe the series will be refreshing to viewers. There is no doubt that
      that the fashion, bitchiness and drama will live up to our expectations,
      so I feel viewers should be optimistic on this rebooted series, even if
      there are feelings of nostalgia on the Gossip Girl blasts of old.
